## 2. Setting Up the Environment

### Installing Python

| **Step** | **What to do?**                                |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). |
| 2        | Download the latest version (Python 3).        |
| 3        | Run the installer. Check **“Add Python to PATH”** on Windows. |

### Installation on Different Systems

- **Windows:** Double-click the installer and follow the steps.  
- **macOS:** Use the installer or `brew install python`.  
- **Linux:** Usually pre-installed. If not, use `sudo apt install python3`.

| VSCode              | Lightweight and works with many languages.   |
| Jupyter Notebook    | Great for experiments and learning step by step. |

---

### Python Interpreter & Interactive Mode

- Open **Command Prompt/Terminal**.  
- Type `python` or `python3`.  
- Try small commands:  

   ```python
   >>> print("Hello")
   Hello

---

### Your First Python Script

1. Open your editor.

2. Create a new file: `hello.py`.

3. Write:

   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

4. Run the file:

   * **In Terminal:** `python hello.py`
   * **In IDE:** Click **Run**.
